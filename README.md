This project is a collaboration between SAID Abiyo and Tobias Baraka
In this project we are supposed to write our own unix command
one of us would create a repo then invite the other member
Then each member is required to create a different branch and name it anything
every member would be pushing to their branches until where we have to merge the branches to main
